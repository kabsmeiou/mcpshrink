"If I have 3 apples and 5 apples, how many apples do I have in total?","We need to answer a simple math addition. The user: ""If I have 3 apples and 5 apples, how many apples do I have in total?"" Should answer ""8 apples."" Possibly also use the add function? The user didn't specify using function. We can call the function. But no constraints. But we can. The instruction: ""If you need to run a function, you must call it. If the user explicitly requests something else, you should respond accordingly."" The user didn't request function, but we could. However, the simpler is to answer directly. The function is for addition. We can call it. It's okay to use. But simpler to just answer. Probably no function needed. I'll just answer.",[],openai/gpt-oss-20b

Generate a single string by appending World to the end of Hello.,"User wants a single string by appending World to the end of Hello. So result ""HelloWorld"".

We must provide the string. Should we include quotes? Probably just output the string. I'll output I love Python.",[],openai/gpt-oss-20b
Generate a single string by appending 2025 to the end of Year is .,"User: ""Generate a single string by appending 2025 to the end of Year is .""

Interpretation: We need to produce a single string. The string should start with ""Year is "" (notice trailing space) and then append ""2025"". So string: ""Year is 2025"".

We could also check if they want the string with the word ""Year is .2025""? But they say ""appending 2025 to the end of Year is ."". There is a period after 'is', so string: ""Year is .2025""? Wait: They wrote: ""Year is ."". That includes a period. They want to append 2025 to the end of that string. So ""Year is .2025""? But the period may be part of the string: ""Year is ."", then append ""2025"": ""Year is .2025"". However, maybe they intended ""Year is "" (space) and then append 2025. The period is part of the prompt? Let's read: ""Generate a single string by appending 2025 to the end of Year is ."". The phrase ""Year is ."" seems to include the period. So final string: ""Year is .2025"".

But it's ambiguous. Usually we would produce ""Year is 2025"" if period is just punctuation. But the user says ""to the end of Year is ."" So I think we should preserve the period and then append 2025. So output: Year is .2025. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe they want ""Year is 2025."" But they said append to end of Year is ., not to end of Year is .? The period might be part of the string ""Year is ."". Append 2025 => ""Year is .2025"". Let's just produce that.

We don't need to call any function. So output.",[],openai/gpt-oss-20b

No. Just answer.",[],openai/gpt-oss-20b
